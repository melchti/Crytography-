# Crytography-
This assignment covers cryptography, steganography, SSL certificates, and cracking hashes with Hashcat.

In this unit, I learn about cryptography, the art and science of keeping information secure using mathematical concepts and techniques.

•	The first day I learned the history of cryptography, the difference between encyption and encoding, and how to use a tool called Open SSL to encrypt and decrypt a message.

•	The second day I continued with the topic of encryption, exploring how asymmetric encryption can address challenges of symmetric encryption. I also learned important 
cryptographic concepts such as hashing and digital signatures.

•	The third day I explored how the cryptographic concepts learned throughout the week are applied to modern technology. I learned topics such as steganography, SSL certificates, and cracking hashes with Hashcat.



The Scenario for this assignment was as follows:

In this homework assignment, you will play the role of a cybersecurity analyst at Nakatomi Hospital.

•	Unfortunately, one of the hospital's doctors opened up an email containing ransomware.

•	This ransomware spread throughout the hospital and encrypted all of the Patient Records.

•	The ransomware has given you two options to decrypt and retrieve the patient records: Either pay 100 bitcoins or solve six riddles.

•	Since you refuse to pay off any ransom, you'll have to solve six cryptographic riddles. Act fast: the doctors need to access the patient records as lives are at stake!



The entire homework assignment can be completed on a publicly available website linked below. If for any reason, the website has issues or is unavailable, an offline copy has also been provided.

In order to solve each riddle, you will need to apply cryptographic concepts covered in the past three lessons. concepts will need to be applied.

•	Once the riddle has been solved, submit your answer on the bottom of each Riddle Page.

•	If you are correct, you will receive a key. Save this key in your notes.

•	Once you have collected all six keys, select the Ransomware Decrypted header on the website and enter all your keys.

•	If all the six keys are correct, the ransomware will be removed and the data will be decrypted.

•	You will need to submit a screenshot as proof that the ransomware has been decrypted.
